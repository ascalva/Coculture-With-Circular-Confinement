Coculture With Circular Confinement
===================================

**Author**: Alberto Serrano

## Running the simulation
1. Run `make` to get an executable file.
    - Remove the compilation flag `-DCMD_OUT` from makefile if you want the data to be outputted to a file (1.out).
2. Run `./coculture` and direct the output to `coculture.dat` to plot.
3. Run `./run.sh` from within the plots directory to animate the output of the program.
4. (Optional) Use `make clean` and `make cleanjunk` to remove .o files and excess images.
